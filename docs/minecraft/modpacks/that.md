# Welcome to the Wiki for THAT!

Here, expect to find helpful information about the modpack, and what you can do to get started.

## What is THAT?

First, it might be a good idea to break down what THAT is in the first place. THAT is primarily a community driven pack meant for groups of all sizes. This does not mean no singleplayer, the scope of the pack just didn't have a singleplayer first mindset. Being kitchen-sink-esque, there's many things to do and accomplish, and that's all down to you. The original minecraft feel, just WIDELY expanded the options you have.

## Suggested First Steps

You can take many routes, but you might consider these top 3 options.
- Cobblemon is your friend! These guys are ridable and can help with some of your tasks
- Get started early with Create, as many things surround it
- Be a farmer! Gain benefits from different foods

## Final Thoughts

Of course, keep in mind you shape your adventure. Future changes may change these recommendations. Check back frequently!
